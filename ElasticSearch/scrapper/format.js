              "text": "Car Insurance is a contract you and your insurer enter into, to protect you from financial damages caused by unforeseeable circumstances like accidents, theft, and even natural calamities. The Government of India has made it mandatory for all car owners to have a third-party car insurance policy. This policy covers the damages caused to life and property of individuals, other than you, affected by an accident your car unfortunately becomes a part of. The other most common form of insurance is Comprehensive Car Insurance. It helps you cover majority of the liabilities you might attract if your car gets damaged in a social unrest, natural calamity, or even gets stolen in a case of theft. As a car owner, it is important for you to have the right car insurance policy. When searching for car insurance online, make sure you completely understand the nature and terms & conditions of the policy. Bajaj Allianz Team is here to help you navigate the journey of having our own car insurance with a seamless process."
