# PS9_Horizon

An AI based chatbot system for the customer care service of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company(BAGIC) to reduce the current customer contact footprint from 40.3% to below 5% and move the same to chat, voice and video bots.
<b/>
Users will be able to interact with the chat system in 3 ways: Chat, Voice (Voice Bot) and Video (DeepFake).
<b/>
The user can ask their query in the form of text or audio. The processed answer will be returned in one of the 3 ways mentioned above depending on the userâ€™s choice.
<b/>
The user questions will be first searched through the most commonly searched FAQs (available on the BAGIC website), if the engine does not find a suitable answer for the the users query, it will then use a search engine developed using Elastic search and Information retrieval models (AI) on the data scraped from the BAGIC website to search for the answer.
</b>
The output will be given in either a video format which is synthetically created using deepfake models (to make it look like a real person is speaking), audio format using text to speech technology or a simple textual reply.
